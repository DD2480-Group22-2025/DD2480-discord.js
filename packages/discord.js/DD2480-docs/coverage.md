# Coverage measurement and Improvement

## Task 1: DIY

Implement branch coverage by manual instrumentation of the source code for five functions
with high cyclomatic complexity. Use a separate development branch or repo for this, as this code is
not permanent. The simplest method for this is as follows:

1. Identify all branches in the given functions; assign a unique number (ID) to each one.
2. Before the program starts (before the first instruction in “main” or as the first step in the unit test
   harness), create data structures that hold coverage information about specific branches.
3. Before the first statement of each branch outcome (including to-be-added “else” clauses if none exist),
   add a line that sets a flag if the branch is reached.
4. At the end of the program (as the last instruction in “main” or at the end of all unit tests), write all
   information about the taken branches taken to a file or console.

   Note: It is perfectly fine if your coverage tool is inefficient (memory-wise or time-wise) and its output may
   be hard to read. For example, you may allocate 100 coverage measurement points to each function, so
   you can easily divide the entries into a fixed-size array.

- What is the quality of your own coverage measurement? Does it take into account ternary operators
  (condition ? yes : no) and exceptions, if available in your language?
  It takes into account anything depending on what branches you decide on including in the coverage measurement. For ternary operators, you would have to rewrite the code to include the branches properly. Since we are manually adding flags to each branch, we can also easily include exceptions.
- What are the limitations of your tool? How would the instrumentation change if you modify the
  program?
  It would be a lot of work to modify the instrumentation to work with the program. Because of the manual nature of the instrumentation, you would have to rewrite the code to include the branches properly.
- If you have an automated tool, are your results consistent with the ones produced by existing tool(s)?

There is an automated testing suite for discordjs, but it doesn't cover any of the functions that we are analysing. Therefore, we can't compare the results, and have decided to create our own mini-suite to test the functions.

### \src\structures\Attachment.js: \_patch - Carl

- The branch coverage for the \_patch function in Attachment.js is 45%,
  with 8 out of 20 covered branches.

### \src\structures\VoiceState.js: \_patch - Klara

### \src\structures\ApplicationCommand.js: equals - Jacob

### \src\structures\ThreadChannel.js: \_patch - Phoebe

### \src\structures\Guild.js: \_patch - Samuel

## Task 2: Coverage improvement

- In the five functions with high cyclomatic complexity, what is the current branch coverage? Is branch coverage
  higher or lower than in the rest of the code (if you have automated coverage)?

None of the \_patch functions have any branch coverage at all, so the coverage is definitely lower than in the rest of the code, which has about 38% branch coverage.

Keep a record (copy) of your coverage before you start working on new tests. Furthermore, make
sure you add the new tests on a different branch than the one you used for coverage instrumentation.
Having identified “weak spots” in coverage, try to improve coverage with additional test cases.

1. Identify the requirements that are tested or untested by the given test suite.
2. Document the requirements (as comments), and use them later as assertions.
3. Create new test cases as needed to improve branch coverage in the given functions. Can you call the
   function directly? Can you expand on existing tests? Do you have to add additional interfaces to the
   system (as public methods) to make it possible to set up test data structures?
4. If you have 100 % branch coverage, you can choose other functions or think about path coverage. You
   may cover all branches in a function, but what does this mean for the combination of branches? Consider
   the existing tests by hand and check how they cover the branches (in which combinations)

### \src\structures\Attachment.js: \_patch - Carl

By introducing new tests for the \_patch function in Attachment.js,
I managed to achieve 100% coverage.

### \src\structures\VoiceState.js: \_patch - Klara

### \src\structures\ApplicationCommand.js: equals - Jacob

Initiially, the coverage of the function was 0. It was furthermore quite hard to measure since most of the CCN came from ternary statements and disjunctions in the big if-statement. These were impossible to measure with our DYI-tool without rewriting the function into multiple seperate if-statements. As such the result might not be very telling, but the coverage was still increased from 0 to 80 % meaning that the code inside 4 of 5 if-statments are checked. 

### \src\structures\ThreadChannel.js: \_patch - Phoebe

This function had no testing already created so we needed to create our own testing environment and tests for the function. This meant that the coverage was 0 and could only be increased from there.

### \src\structures\Guild.js: \_patch - Samuel
