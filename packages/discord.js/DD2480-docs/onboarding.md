# Onboarding

## How good is the onboarding documentation? How easily can you build the project? Briefly describe if everything worked as documented or not:
- Did you have to install a lot of additional tools to build the software?

- Were those tools well documented?

- Were other components installed automatically by the build script?

- Did the build conclude automatically without errors?

- How well do examples and tests run on your system(s)?
